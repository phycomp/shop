Steps for Using Google Trends to Optimize SEO Keywords:
    1. Install the pytrends library.
    2. Extract trending data for the keywords you're using or considering.
    3. Analyze the popularity and performance of these keywords.
    4. Optimize your SEO strategy by focusing on trending keywords and regions where they are popular.
Installation:
First, install the pytrends library:
pip install pytrends
Python Code for Using Google Trends API:
from pytrends.request import TrendReq
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Initialize the pytrends object
pytrends = TrendReq(hl='en-US', tz=360)

# Step 2: Define the list of keywords for SEO
keywords = ['SEO 顧問', '數位行銷', '網路行銷', '品牌行銷顧問', '關鍵字廣告']

# Step 3: Get Google Trends data for the keywords
pytrends.build_payload(keywords, cat=0, timeframe='today 12-m', geo='TW', gprop='')

# Step 4: Retrieve the interest over time data
interest_over_time_df = pytrends.interest_over_time()

# Step 5: Plot the interest over time
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
for keyword in keywords:
    plt.plot(interest_over_time_df.index, interest_over_time_df[keyword], label=keyword)
    
plt.title('Interest Over Time for SEO Keywords')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Interest')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Step 6: Retrieve related queries for each keyword
related_queries_dict = pytrends.related_queries()

# Step 7: Display related queries and their values
for keyword in keywords:
    print(f"Related queries for {keyword}:")
    print(related_queries_dict[keyword]['top'])
    print("\n")
Explanation of the Code:
    1. TrendReq Initialization: pytrends connects to the Google Trends API. You can specify the language (hl='en-US') and timezone (tz=360).
    2. Keyword Definition: You define a list of keywords (in this case, the ones relevant to 洸寅顧問公司).
    3. Google Trends Payload: This collects data for the keywords, focusing on Taiwan (geo='TW') over the past 12 months (timeframe='today 12-m').
    4. Interest Over Time: The script fetches search interest data over time and plots it using matplotlib to visualize keyword trends.
    5. Related Queries: This section fetches related queries for each keyword, showing you other potential keywords you can target for SEO optimization.
Enhancing SEO with Google Trends Data:
    1. Identify Seasonal Trends:
        ◦ By looking at the interest over time, you can identify seasonal spikes in keyword searches. For example, some keywords might perform better during certain months or events.
        ◦ Focus your SEO campaigns around these high-interest periods.
    2. Discover Related Keywords:
        ◦ The related queries data helps you discover new, high-performing keywords you might not have considered. These related terms often have lower competition but similar search intent, making them valuable for SEO.
        ◦ You can use these related keywords to expand your content strategy and drive more organic traffic.
    3. Optimize Regionally:
        ◦ Google Trends provides regional data, showing which areas are most interested in specific keywords. You can tailor your SEO strategy to target regions where your services are in higher demand.
        ◦ For example, if "SEO 顧問" is trending in certain cities or regions in Taiwan, you can create region-specific content or run localized ad campaigns.
    4. Measure Keyword Performance:
        ◦ By tracking keyword interest over time, you can measure the effectiveness of your SEO efforts. If certain keywords are declining in popularity, you may want to shift your focus to more trending topics.
Example Output:
    • Interest Over Time Plot: Shows the fluctuations in search interest for each keyword over the last 12 months.
    • Related Queries: Lists other popular keywords related to your primary keywords, which you can incorporate into your SEO strategy.

跟洸寅顧問公司 每月花費 NTD 2880 在六組關鍵字上 請問其CP值 是否合理
To evaluate if the monthly spending of NTD 2880 on six keywords is reasonable, we need to assess the CP value (Cost-Performance value) by considering the following key metrics for each keyword:
    1. Search Volume: How many times the keyword is searched per month.
    2. Cost Per Click (CPC): The amount paid for each click on an ad using that keyword.
    3. Competition: The competitiveness of the keyword in both organic search and paid ads.
Formula for CP Value:
 Value Volume LevelCP Value=CPC×Competition LevelSearch Volume​
This gives us an idea of how effective the keywords are relative to their cost and competition.
Steps to Calculate if CP Value is Reasonable:
    1. Identify the Keywords and Metrics:
        ◦ Collect the six keywords that 洸寅顧問公司 is using.
        ◦ Use a tool like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Ahrefs to gather data on:
            ▪ Search Volume (monthly searches).
            ▪ CPC (average cost per click in NTD).
            ▪ Competition Level (usually on a scale of 0 to 1 or 0 to 100).
    2. Calculate the Total Monthly Clicks:
        ◦ With NTD 2880 spent per month, if we know the CPC for each keyword, we can estimate the number of clicks generated:
        per month BudgetClicks per month=CPCMonthly Budget​
       For six keywords, this would be the aggregate clicks across all keywords.
    3. Assess Traffic Potential:
        ◦ Multiply the clicks by the conversion rate (the percentage of people clicking who become leads or customers). This helps determine the actual return on investment (ROI).
Example Calculation:
Suppose the six keywords have the following metrics:
Keyword	Search Volume	CPC (NTD)	Competition (Scale 0-100)
SEO 顧問	5000	10	40
數位行銷	10000	20	70
網路行銷	8000	15	50
品牌行銷顧問	3000	25	60
關鍵字廣告	2000	30	80
行銷策略顧問	2500	18	55
Total Monthly Spend: NTD 2880
Average CPC Calculation:
    • For simplicity, let's assume average CPC = NTD 20.
    • Clicks per month:
202880​=144clicks/month
CP Value Calculation (For each keyword):
Using the CP Value formula for each keyword:
    • SEO 顧問:  ValueCP Value=10×405000​=12.5
    • 數位行銷:  ValueCP Value=20×7010000​=7.14
    • 網路行銷:  ValueCP Value=15×508000​=10.67
(Continue for the rest of the keywords.)
Conclusion:
If the CP values of most keywords are high (greater than 5–10), it means that the spending is effective, providing a good balance of search volume, cost, and competitiveness. For example, if keywords like SEO 顧問 and 網路行銷 have CP values around 10, they are performing well in terms of traffic and cost.
Is NTD 2880 Reasonable?
    • High CP Value: If the CP values are consistently high (above 8-10), then the monthly spend of NTD 2880 is reasonable.
    • Low CP Value: If the CP values are low (below 5), this could indicate high competition or high CPC, suggesting the keywords might not be yielding optimal traffic or conversions, making the spend less effective.
By regularly monitoring keyword performance and adjusting the strategy based on the CP value, 洸寅顧問公司 can ensure that NTD 2880 is being used efficiently.
